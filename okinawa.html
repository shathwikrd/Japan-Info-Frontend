                Okinawa Island (沖縄島, Okinawa-jima, Okinawan: 沖縄/うちなー, Uchinaa[4] Kunigami: ふちなー, Fuchináa), officially Okinawa Main Island (沖縄本島, Okinawa-hontō),[5] is the largest of the Okinawa Islands and the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands of Japan in the Kyushu region. It is the smallest and least populated of the five main islands of Japan.[6] The island is approximately 106 kilometres (66 mi) long, an average 11 kilometres (7 mi) wide,[7] and has an area of 1,206.98 square kilometers (466.02 sq mi). It is roughly 640 kilometres (350 nmi; 400 mi) south of the main island of Kyushu and the rest of Japan. It is 500 km (270 nmi; 310 mi) northeast of Taiwan. The total population of Okinawa Island is 1,384,762.[3] The greater Naha area has roughly 800,000 residents, while the city itself has about 320,000 people. Naha is the seat of Okinawa Prefecture on the southwestern part of Okinawa Island. Okinawa has a humid subtropical climate..

            <p>As of September 2009, the Japanese government estimates the population at 1,384,762,[3] which includes American military personnel and their families. The Okinawan language, called Uchināguchi, is spoken by adults only,[25] but several local groups promote the use of the Okinawan language by younger people.[26]

                Whereas the northern half of Okinawa Island is sparsely populated, the south-central and southern parts of the island are markedly urbanized—particularly the city of Naha and the urban corridor stretching north from there to Okinawa City. The population distribution is approximately 120,000 in northern Okinawa, 590,000 in central Okinawa and 540,000 in southern Okinawa. It has a high population density of 1,014.93/km2.[27]As of September 2009, the Japanese government estimates the population at 1,384,762,[3] which includes American military personnel and their families.
