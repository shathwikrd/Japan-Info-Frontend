        <h3 class="underline">About</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Osaka (Japanese: 大阪市, Hepburn: Ōsaka-shi, pronounced [oːsakaɕi]; commonly just 大阪, Ōsaka [oːsaka] ⓘ) is a
            designated city in the Kansai region of Honshu in Japan, and one of the three major cities of Japan
            (Tokyo-Osaka-Nagoya). It is the capital of and most populous city in Osaka Prefecture, and the third-most
            populous city in Japan, following the special wards of Tokyo and Yokohama. With a population of 2.7 million
            in the 2020 census, it is also the largest component of the Keihanshin Metropolitan Area, which is the
            second-largest metropolitan area in Japan[4] and the 10th-largest urban area in the world with more than 19
            million inhabitants.Following the Meiji Restoration, Osaka greatly expanded in size and underwent rapid
            industrialization. In 1889, Osaka was officially established as a municipality. The construction boom
            accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by the 1900s, Osaka was the industrial
            hub in the Meiji and Taishō periods. Osaka made noted contributions to redevelopment, urban planning and
            zoning standards in the postwar period, and the city developed rapidly as one of the major financial centers
            in the Keihanshin Metropolitan Area.

        <div class="para d-flex">
            <p>
                Osaka has a large number of wholesalers and retail shops: 25,228 and 34,707 respectively in 2004,
                according to the city statistics.[80] Many of them are concentrated in the wards of Chuō (10,468 shops)
                and Kita (6,335 shops). Types of shops vary from malls to conventional shōtengai shopping arcades, built
                both above- and underground.[81] Shōtengai are seen across Japan, and Osaka has the longest one in the
                country.[82] The Tenjinbashi-suji arcade stretches from the road approaching the Tenmangū shrine and
                continues for 2.6 km (1.6 miles) going north to south. The stores along the arcade include commodities,
                clothing, and catering outlets.
                Other shopping areas include Den Den Town, the electronic and manga/anime district, which is comparable
                to Akihabara; the Umeda district, which has the Hankyu Sanbangai shopping mall and Yodobashi Camera, a
                huge electrical appliance store that offers a vast range of fashion stores, restaurants, and a Shonen
                Jump store. Osaka is known for its food, in Japan and abroad. Author Michael Booth and food critic
                François Simon of Le Figaro have suggested that Osaka is the food capital of the world.[83] Osakans'
                love for the culinary is made apparent in the old saying "Kyotoites are financially ruined by
                overspending on clothing, Osakans are ruined by spending on food."[84]

            <p>Tokyo is home to a wide array of museums, art galleries, and libraries, catering to various interests.
                Ueno
                Park has the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum specializing in traditional Japanese
                art,[203] the National Museum of Western Art, whose building designed by Le Corbusier is a world
                heritage
                site,[204] and the National Museum of Nature and Science. Ueno Zoo is also located within the park, near
                the
                Shinobazu Pond. It is famous for being one of the three zoos in Japan to have giant pandas, with a
                population of 4 as of May 2024.[205] Other notable museums include the Artizon Museum in Chūō, the
                National
                Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba, and the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, which provides
                insights into the history and culture of Tokyo. The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum preserves
                various buildings that have existed throughout the history of Tokyo. The Nezu Museum in Aoyama has a
                collection of pre-modern Japanese and East Asian art. Located near the Imperial Palace, the National
                Diet
                Library, the National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art are also notable cultural
                institutions. Additionally, the Mori Art Museum in Roppongi and the Sumida Hokusai Museum in Sumida ward
                are
                notable for their contemporary and ukiyo-e art collections, respectively. The Sompo Museum of Art in
                Shinjuku is best known for owning one of Gogh's Sunflowers. The Tokyo Metropolitan Garden Art Museum in
                Minato features the former Tokyo House of Yasuhiko, Prince Asaka, which was built in an opulent Art Deco
                style in 1933. The Railway Museum, which used to be located in Kanda, has relocated to a larger site in
                Omiya, Saitama and stores 42 train carriages and locomotives of historical importance.[206] The Tobacco
                and
                Salt Museum in Sumida has one of the world's most extensive collections of different types of tobacco
                and
                salt. Major aquariums in Tokyo include: Shinagawa Aquarium, Tokyo Sea Life Park, Sunshine Aquarium and
                Sumida Aquarium.

            <p>Tokyo's buildings are too diverse to be characterized by any specific archtectural style, but it can be
                generally said that a majority of extant structures were built in the past a hundred years;[121] twice
                in
                recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later
                after extensive firebombing in World War II.[121]
                The oldest known extant building in Tokyo is Shofukuji in Higashi-Murayama. The current building was
                constructed in 1407, during the Muromachi period (1336–1573).[122] Although greatly reduced in number by
                later fires, earthquakes, and air raids, a considerable number of Edo-era buildings survive to this day.
                The
                Tokyo Imperial Palace, which was occupied by the Tokugawa Shogunate as Edo Castle during the Edo Period
                (1603–1868), has many gates and towers dating from that era, although the main palace buildings and the
                tenshu tower have been lost.[123]</p>
