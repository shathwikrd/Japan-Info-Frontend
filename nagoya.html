                During the Meiji Restoration Japan's provinces were restructured into prefectures and the government
                changed from family to bureaucratic rule. Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and
                designated a city on 1 September 1956, by government ordinance. Nagoya became an industrial hub for the
                region. Its economic sphere included the famous pottery towns of Tokoname, Tajimi and Seto, as well as
                Okazaki, one of the only places where gunpowder was produced under the shogunate. Other industries
                included cotton and complex mechanical dolls called karakuri ningyō.During the Meiji Restoration Japan's

            <p>Nagoya was a major trading city and political seat of the Owari lords, the most important house of the
                Tokugawa clan. They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially Tokugawa Muneharu,
                the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and
                actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants.
                Culture flourished after the feudal Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji era. During the Pacific
                War many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the

            <p>Nagoya was the target of air raids during the Pacific War. The population of Nagoya at this time was
                estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the
                Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft
                production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the
                city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of Kagamigahara. It was estimated
                that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital
                Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment,
                metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during the war.Nagoya was the target of air
