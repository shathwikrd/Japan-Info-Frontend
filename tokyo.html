        <br>
        <p>Tokyo, officially the Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of the most populous cities in the
            world, with a population of over 14 million residents within the city proper as of 2023. The Greater Tokyo
            Area, which includes Tokyo and parts of six neighboring prefectures, is the most-populous metropolitan area
            in the world, with 41 million residents as of 2024.
            Located at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kantō region on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's
            largest island. Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the
            Emperor of Japan. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo's central 23 special wards (which
            formerly made up Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying
            island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.

        <h3 class="underline">History</h3>
        <div class="para d-flex">
            <p>Tokyo was originally a village called Edo, part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by
                the
                Edo clan in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle to defend the region from the
                Chiba clan. After Dōkan was assassinated in 1486, the castle and the area came to be possessed by
                several
                feudal lords. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu was granted the Kantō region by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and moved
                there
                from his ancestral land of Mikawa Province. He greatly expanded the castle, which was said to have been
                abandoned and in tatters when he moved there, and ruled the region from there. When he became shōgun,
                the de
                facto ruler of the country, in 1603, the whole country came to be ruled from Edo. While the Tokugawa
                shogunate ruled the country in practice, the Imperial House of Japan was still the de jure ruler, and
                the
                title of shōgun was granted by the Emperor as a formality. The Imperial House was based in Kyoto from
                794 to
                1868, so Edo was still not the capital of Japan.[29] During the Edo period, the city enjoyed a prolonged
                period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a
                stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the
                city.[30] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources
                to
                rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters
                that
                plagued the city. Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population reaching one
                million by the 18th century.[31]

            <p>Tokyo is home to a wide array of museums, art galleries, and libraries, catering to various interests.
                Ueno
                Park has the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum specializing in traditional Japanese
                art,[203] the National Museum of Western Art, whose building designed by Le Corbusier is a world
                heritage
                site,[204] and the National Museum of Nature and Science. Ueno Zoo is also located within the park, near
                the
                Shinobazu Pond. It is famous for being one of the three zoos in Japan to have giant pandas, with a
                population of 4 as of May 2024.[205] Other notable museums include the Artizon Museum in Chūō, the
                National
                Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba, and the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, which provides
                insights into the history and culture of Tokyo. The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum preserves
                various buildings that have existed throughout the history of Tokyo. The Nezu Museum in Aoyama has a
                collection of pre-modern Japanese and East Asian art. Located near the Imperial Palace, the National
                Diet
                Library, the National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art are also notable cultural
                institutions. Additionally, the Mori Art Museum in Roppongi and the Sumida Hokusai Museum in Sumida ward
                are
                notable for their contemporary and ukiyo-e art collections, respectively. The Sompo Museum of Art in
                Shinjuku is best known for owning one of Gogh's Sunflowers. The Tokyo Metropolitan Garden Art Museum in
                Minato features the former Tokyo House of Yasuhiko, Prince Asaka, which was built in an opulent Art Deco
                style in 1933. The Railway Museum, which used to be located in Kanda, has relocated to a larger site in
                Omiya, Saitama and stores 42 train carriages and locomotives of historical importance.[206] The Tobacco
                and
                Salt Museum in Sumida has one of the world's most extensive collections of different types of tobacco
                and
                salt. Major aquariums in Tokyo include: Shinagawa Aquarium, Tokyo Sea Life Park, Sunshine Aquarium and
                Sumida Aquarium.

        <div class="d-flex">
            <p>Tokyo's buildings are too diverse to be characterized by any specific archtectural style, but it can be
                generally said that a majority of extant structures were built in the past a hundred years;[121] twice
                in
                recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later
                after extensive firebombing in World War II.[121]
                The oldest known extant building in Tokyo is Shofukuji in Higashi-Murayama. The current building was
                constructed in 1407, during the Muromachi period (1336–1573).[122] Although greatly reduced in number by
                later fires, earthquakes, and air raids, a considerable number of Edo-era buildings survive to this day.
                The
                Tokyo Imperial Palace, which was occupied by the Tokugawa Shogunate as Edo Castle during the Edo Period
                (1603–1868), has many gates and towers dating from that era, although the main palace buildings and the
                tenshu tower have been lost.[123]</p>
