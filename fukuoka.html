        <p>Fukuoka (Japanese: 福岡市, Fukuoka-shi, [ɸɯ̥kɯoka ꜜɕi] ⓘ) is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital
            city of Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has been a center
            of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country,
            as it is the nearest point among Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans occupied the
            area since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka area.
            The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the
            relatively great distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo),
            Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has persisted to the present.

            Fukuoka is the most populous city on Kyūshū island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and
            metropolitan area west of Keihanshin. The city was designated by government ordinance on April 1, 1972.
            Greater Fukuoka, with a population of 2.5 million people (2005 census), is part of the heavily
            industrialized Fukuoka–Kitakyushu zone.Fukuoka (Japanese: 福岡市, Fukuoka-shi, [ɸɯ̥kɯoka ꜜɕi] ⓘ) is the

                Kublai sent another envoy to Japan in 1279. At that time, Hōjō Tokimune of the Hōjō clan (1251–1284) was
                the Eighth Regent. Not only did he decline the offer, but he beheaded the five Mongolian emissaries
                after summoning them to Kamakura. Infuriated, Kublai organized another attack on Fukuoka Prefecture in
                1281, mobilizing 140,000 soldiers and 4,000 ships. The Japanese defenders, numbering around 40,000, were
                no match for the Mongols and the invasion force made it as far as Dazaifu, 15 km (9 mi) south of the
                city of Fukuoka. However, the Japanese were again aided by severe weather, this time by a typhoon that
                struck a crushing blow to the Mongolian troops, thwarting the invasion.[11]Kublai sent another envoy to

            <p>As of September 2009, the Japanese government estimates the population at 1,384,762,[3] which includes
                American military personnel and their families. The Okinawan language, called Uchināguchi, is spoken by
                adults only,[25] but several local groups promote the use of the Okinawan language by younger
                people.[26]

                Whereas the northern half of Okinawa Island is sparsely populated, the south-central and southern parts
                of the island are markedly urbanized—particularly the city of Naha and the urban corridor stretching
                north from there to Okinawa City. The population distribution is approximately 120,000 in northern
                Okinawa, 590,000 in central Okinawa and 540,000 in southern Okinawa. It has a high population density of
